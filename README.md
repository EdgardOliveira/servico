## Desafio 02 - CESAR Interview
### Write two Android application, in the first one, you should create a service (no activities) that receive requests from other apps with an email thread (like
a linked list, please don’t use any list provided by Java or Kotlin you should create your own linked list), write a function that removes duplicated items and
return a cleaned email thread. In the second one, you should create an activity to show an email thread with duplicated items and call the first application to
clean it and update the activity with the email thread returned from the service.
